Prevent -> Detect -> Respond

Attack Scenarios :

	1. build wordlist -> dnsrecon -> burp suite SQLi -> fuzz injection (SQLMap) -> dump key data (exfil)
		- missed by web application vulnerability scanner
		- scenario does not involve patchable flaw

	2. recon target employee (Dr. Gaius via recon-ng) -> Watering hole attack on Dr. Gaius visited site -> Gaius' infected computer establishes C2 back to us -> pivot through corporate system (access token abuse) -> exfil data
		- exploits patchable flaw in client application
		- outbound C2 leveraged for successful attack
		- pivot + scan internal systems to get data exfil

### Router based IPFIX/Netflow : 
	Layer 3/4 information analysis
	packet capture
	Session based analysis
		- timestamps
		- SIP
		- DIP
		- ICMP type
		- UDP/TP ports
		- TCP flags
		- Byte transfers
	Great for APT information
	Decent at filtering (blocking) packets
	Bad for prevention

APT -> Advanced Persistent Threat

Look for persistent outbound threats to say, a foreign country
	- can yield authority for hunting/investigation



### Stateful Inspection Firewalls (SI Firewall) : 
	basic/fast security screening
	SI is deeper than Static Firewalls (can exam corresponding TCP: SYN/ACK tables for google response)
	SIP Address filters
		- blacklist (drop) SIPs that are bogus (Ingress Layer 3)
			= Bogon list : commonly found as the source addresses of DDoS attacks
			= RFC 1918 : Private internets
			= Private internal address space
		- whitelist (Egress Layer 4)

allow any any -> Web Server TCP/80 TCP/443
allow any any -> DNS Server UDP/53
allow any any -> Mail Server TCP/25
...
deny any any -> any any



### Web Application Firewalls :
	WAFs require explicit, serious security knowledge of applications being protected
	Can be both preventative and detective
	Scaling can be an issue
	Many times configured as reverse proxies
	Could use Docker/kubernetes for leveraging scaling of WAFs in a large environment



### NIDS
	Implemented on routing switches
	identify threats outside -> inside
	externally focused nids will NOT detect pivoting attackers
	Really only work with $TRUSTED devices, attacks originating inside a network are kind of difficult
		- imagine trusted (infected) host to trusted (victim), IDS can't see this
	Enable rapid response though 



### NIPS
	false positives on NIDS are an annoyance, on NIPS it's service outage!



### NGFWs
	Complement SI firewalls
	Best at Layer 7 (overtly emphasized here)
	Ex.
		Facebook chat :
		- SI firewall can block TCP/80 (overkill) or FB DIPs (statically, hard to scale)
		- NGFWs can Block FB chat (still allow FB) and reserve chat for executives only
	Cisco NGFW
	OpenAppId (Cisco)
		- integrates with snort
	Great at blocking C2 sent via TCP 443/80



### Malware Detonation Devices (MDDs, ATPrev, Automated Malware Analysis)
	Takes files and render/executes them in advance of passing them off to the target
	Sandbox environments
	Behavioral Analysis machines
	Could implement Cuckoo on Docker containers for scalable solution



### Forward Proxies
	Usually contain web content filtering
	Primary purpose is to reduce risk associated with user accessing content
	MIME type content filtering (.exe, .jar, doc, .pdf, etc..)
	Splash proxies are cool (validate first use of website with user prompt)


### Word Entropy
	3i8ojqsj49.exe is probably malicious
	notevil.exe could be considered more suspicious, attackers would obfuscate this (automagically)
	freq.py -> entropy examination tool
		- look at DNS names for signs of randomness
		- cron job or task scheduler can make freq.py a simple task
		- freq_server.py can be leveraged against ELK-based SIEMs
	linux $ent can provide entropy insight as well


### SIEM/SIM
	Security Information and Event Mangement
	enables rapid response and indrectly aid prevention
	very detection based


### Pcap devices
	Leveraged as a second opinion (after we determine things)
	Sort of a more in-depth look

Honeypots
VLAN ACLs - provide logically segmented internal networks
	VACLs - Virtual access control lists
	Should desktops be able to talk to other desktops directly? Probably not!
	Good against Pivot prevention

Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
