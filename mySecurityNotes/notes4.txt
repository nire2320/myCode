Application monitoring + whitelisting
common secure configs
expedited patching of applications + OSes
Controlling admin privileges

ADFS

Desktops are more difficult to secure
	- users are insane/evil/easier to reach

supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)

Patching is the most important security aspect of securing enterprises

Patch Cycle :
	Patch identification
	possible patch testing
	patch deployment
	patch verification - vulnerability scanners help here

iDay / ForeverDay vulnerabilities

DISABLE SMBv1

eliminate software that is not needed by the organization anymore

3 Don't do's :
	DON'T build a config of a modern system from scratch
	DON'T deploy the hardest possible configuration/most hardcore
	DON'T consider it done after you've finished/consider this a 1-off procecss

CIS provides good benchmark baseline configurations
Vendor's do too
NSA does as well

Monitor systems for configuration changes (diff)

Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (MS EMET)

Whitelisting (Sysmon)
	Centralize events via your SIEM

whitelisting applications allows us to look for deviation
	prevent someoen from successfully executing a binary

Zone.identifier in windows ADFS

AppLocker
	automatic creation of default rules
	control which apps and files users can run

Control Admin access
	limit pass_the_hash
		- NTLM network auth starts with hash rather than password
		- no salts for LM or NT hashes
		- windows credential editor
		- msf psexec
		- mimikatz
	exploit with Windows Escalate Service Permissions  /service_permissions
	Scrutinize the following in a system :
		- allow/deny log on locally
		- allow log on through rdp services
		- deny access via network
		- logon as a service

Auto Start Extensibility Points (ASEP)
	persistent applications
	persistent evil

mimikatz/dogz/yakz exploit

Logging onto Windows System
	Console
	RDP
	Service
	Over network
	Cached creds
	etc..
