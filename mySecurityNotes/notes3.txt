Network Security Monitoring (NSM) != Continuous Security Monitoring (CSM)

NSM
	Data in motion
	NIDS
	Packets
	Pipeline flow
	Security Onion (best option, also free)
		- comes with NIDS : Snort, Suricata, Bro; SGuil
		- PRADS
		- netsniff-ng
		- SIEM (elsa)
		- Wireshark, Network Miner, nmap, ngrep, etc...
	Data Sources :
		- Packet Data
		- Flow Data
		- Transaction Data
		- Statistical Data
		- Alert Data
		- Correlated Data
	A system can be as simple as a combined sensor + server
	Better system is multiple sensors and a centralized server
	Sensor Placement
		- DMZ
		- Internal
		- External

CSM
	Data at rest
	Log files
	Registry Keys
	Vulnerability assessment
	Weekly scan of missed patches, patch when necessary

Tao : Networking Security Monitoring

Hunt Teams
	Focus on People and Processes
		- dont schedule things on Friday Afternoon for IT to deal with on the weekend! lol

BRO
	bro-cut user _agent uri
	Analysis driven vs. Snort, Sourcefire, Suricata (signature-based)
		- Signature-based is a form of blacklisting
		- blacklisting ALWAYS fails (eventually)
		- Ex.
			= msf to create payload in Raw format
			= convert Raw to .py script
			= convert .py script to .exe
			= bypasses most AVs (signature-based)


Protocol-based
	effective, but often false positives (misconfigured apps using TCP: SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK)
	learning mode attempts to get around this
		- what happens if device learns to ignore malicious traffic? (false negatives)
		- what happens if device learns to alert inconspicuous traffic? (false positives again)


(Alerts)(Flows)(Logs)(pcaps) :: (((DataCorrelation)((DevelopTheories))(ConstructTimelines))) :: (Report)

Dirty word lists can be useful for cross-reference

Magic numbers can identify DOS, .EXEs, etc...

Use NTP to sync time across everything (two synchronized time sources)

Detect and Track .EXEs


SSL/TLS
	Client Hello -> 
	Server Hello + Cert <- 
	Client Key Exchange ->
	Client Finished ->
	Server Finished <-
	Encrypted data <-->

x.509
	popular form of public key certificate
	CN : Common Name
	O  : Organization
	C  : Country Code
	BRO can carave out some useful stuff




TOOLS HERE :

tcpdump
wireshark/tshark
bro
suricata
snort
SIEM (arcsight, LR, etc...)
